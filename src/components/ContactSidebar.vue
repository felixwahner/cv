      Since I first got my hands dirty on a C64 keyboard, I have been in love with technology. I
      started building websites when
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetObjects_Fusion"
        >NetObjects Fusion</a
      >
      and Internet Explorer 3 were still a thing. The year was 1996. I guess time flies by when
      you're having fun ðŸŽ‰.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up, I realized that I could earn money by doing what I did for fun all day long. So
      here I am,
      <strong>{{ ageCounter.years }}</strong> years, {{ ageCounter.days }} days,
      {{ ageCounter.minutes }} minutes and {{ ageCounter.seconds }} seconds later. I have grown a
      little and gained some skills along the way, but I am still hyped for building beautiful and
      purposeful digital products.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, I worked on, led, and launched tons of projects ranging from marketing
      websites based on several CMS and frameworks
      <span class="subtle">(including wordpress, Typo3, processwire, webboard|cms...)</span>, APIs
      <span class="subtle">(built with Laravel, express.js, feathers.js...)</span>, mobile apps
      <span class="subtle"
        >(cross-compiled for iOS and Android using Apache cordova, Ionic, capacitor,
        Flutter...)</span
      >, to real-time web applications rendering thousands of datasets fueled by websockets,
      displayed in custom-made WebGL maps
      <span class="subtle">(powered by Angular, RxJS, pixi.js...)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from writing code, my education as a media designer enabled me to develop UX concepts
      and designs for dozens of applications and websites together with different teams and
      customers all over the world
      <span class="subtle">(using Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, Axure RP, Balsamiq...)</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I've seen a lot, internally I'm still the boy from 1995, restlessly sitting in
      front of his 60-Hz tube monitor at 2 AM, excited about new technology with all its chances and
      possibilities, eager to learn something new every day.

      In my free time, you most likely meet me driving my mountainbike down a trail, in a
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dreamlinehannover">dirtpark</a>
      with my two kids Justus <span class="subtle">(7)</span> and Moritz
      <span class="subtle">(13)</span> or at home, enjoying
